# Jammy shortbread

## Ingredients

* Hard butter, at room temp
* Caster sugar
* Plain flour 
* Ground almonds  
* Pinch of salt (if using unsalted butter)
* Flaked almonds
* Approx 1 jar jam/curd

## Method 

Grease and line a rectangular tin. Preheat oven.

Beat the butter and sugar until combined, then mix in the flour and ground almonds. The mixture should be loose and crumbly.

Tip about 3/4 of the mixture into the lined baking tray and press down firmly. 

Spread the jam on top evenly. 

Add the flaked almonds to the reserved mixture and scatter on top of the jam.

Bake for 45-50mins, until the top is light golden. 

Remove from the oven and leave to cool in the tin.
