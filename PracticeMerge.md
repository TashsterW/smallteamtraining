# Jammy shortbread

## Ingredients

* 200g Hard butter, at room temp
* 100g Caster sugar
* 300g Plain flour 
* 100g Ground almonds  
* Pinch of salt (if using unsalted butter)
* 50g Flaked almonds
* 350g jam/curd

## Method 

Grease and line an 18x28cm rectangular tin. 

Preheat oven to 180&deg;C (Gas Mark 4).

Beat the butter and sugar until combined, then mix in the flour and ground almonds. The mixture should be loose and crumbly.
(If you forgot to let the butter soften to room temperature then beat the cold butter on its own until it softens before adding the sugar, otherwise it'll spray sugar all over your kitchen!)

Tip about 3/4 of the mixture into the lined baking tray and press down firmly. 

Spread the jam on top evenly. 

Add the flaked almonds to the reserved mixture and scatter on top of the jam.

Bake for 35-45mins, until the top is light golden. 

Remove from the oven and leave to cool in the tin.
