# Jammy shortbread

## Ingredients

* 7oz Hard butter, at room temp
* 3.5oz Caster sugar
* 10oz Plain flour 
* 3.5oz Ground almonds  
* Pinch of salt (if using unsalted butter)
* 1.75oz Flaked almonds
* 12oz jam/curd

## Method 

Grease and line a 7 x 11in rectangular tin. 

Preheat oven to 180&deg;C (Gas Mark 4).

Beat the butter and sugar until combined, then mix in the flour and ground almonds. The mixture should be loose and crumbly.
(If you'd rather, you can mix by hand - rub the butter into the dry ingredients like making pastry)

Tip about 3/4 of the mixture into the lined baking tray and press down firmly. 

Spread the jam on top evenly (leave a small border around the edge or it'll bubble up the sides and caramelise).

Add the flaked almonds to the reserved mixture and scatter on top of the jam.

Bake for 35-45mins, until the top is light golden. Cover with a sheet of baking paper partway if it's getting too brown.

Remove from the oven and leave to cool in the tin for a bit, then transfer to a wire rack, slice and enjoy!
